## Summary:

In ice sheets and alpine glaciers, fast-flowing sections are often characterized by crevasse
fields that play a significant role in the cryo-hydrologic system by facilitating meltwater
flow, enhancing basal sliding, weakening the ice, and impacting glacier thermodynamics.
Modeling these fractures at the glacier scale remains challenging and often necessitates
integrating diverse models which hinders the straightforward consideration of physical
issues associated with crevasse fields on a large scale. Here, a new numerical framework
allows us to conduct field-scale experiments and paves the way for a scaling law to elucidate
the macroscopic factors influencing fracture fields and to easily incorporate crevasse depth
and spacing into large-scale models. A newly discovered scaling law highlights the transition
between a mechanical behavior where the regular crevasse spacing is unaffected by geometry
to a regime where geometry plays a significant role, particularly in large-scale fracture
processes like glacier calving. While the numerical experiments in this paper focus on
glaciers, the model and conceptual framework is versatile and can address the mechanical
behavior of fractures in broader geophysical contexts such as snow , rock or ice avalanches,
tectonics and landslides.
